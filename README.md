# Hackathon2020

This folder contains some code for a Shiny application called "Capitec SOAR". This was created for a Hackathon in the space of about a week, the purpose of the project was to create an automated industry report that would allow businesses to benefit from a localized and automated report through an application. This is a rough version and not a proper application, just a Beta version more as a proof of concept, initially this was for a hackathon, but just added it here as some portfolio work.
